### **2\. Typography**

The official brand typeface is Rethink Sans. Its versatility and modern aesthetic support our bold and clear communication style.

**Primary Typeface:**

* **Name:** Rethink Sans  
* **Available Weights:** 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800  
* **Styles:** Normal, Italic  
* **Fallbacks:** system-ui, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

**Usage Rules:**

* **Consistency:** Use only Rethink Sans across all institutional materials.  
* **Hierarchy:** Limit layouts (e.g., presentation slides) to a maximum of three type sizes to maintain clarity.  
* **Case:** Prefer sentence case for long headlines. Title Case is acceptable for short, tactical headlines.  
* **Tracking:** Tighten headings slightly (-1% to 0% tracking). Keep body copy at normal tracking for readability.  
* **Emphasis:** Use **bold** weight for emphasis over color changes. Avoid underlines except for hyperlinks.

**Typographic Scale:**

| Role | Size (px) | Line Height (px) | Weight | Letter Spacing (px) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Display** | 64 | 68 | 700 | \-0.5 |
| **H1** | 48 | 52 | 700 | \-0.25 |
| **H2** | 36 | 40 | 600 | 0 |

| **Caption** | 14 | 20 | 400 | 0 |
| **Micro** | 12 | 16 | 500 | 0 |

### **3\. Color Palette**

Our palette is high-energy, led by a signature orange and contrasted by deep black and crisp neutrals. Accents create modular, billboard-like compositions and should be used sparingly, always ensuring accessible contrast levels. Avoid using all colors at once.

**Primary Palette:**

| Color | Hex | Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Brand Orange** | \#FF4F00 | Primary brand field, CTA backgrounds. |
| **Black** | \#000000 | Typography, silhouettes, graphic shapes. |
| **White** | \#FFFFFF | Type on dark backgrounds, negative space. |
| **Cream** | \#F9F2E7 | Soft background for editorial content.(USED FOR BADGES OR SMALL ELEMENTS) |

**Accent Palette:**

| Color | Hex | Role | Text On |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Purple** | \#4E18FF | Headline fields, tags, backgrounds. | White |
| **Yellow** | \#FECC14 | Highlights, rays, positive UI alerts. | Black |
| **Pink** | \#F577ED | Secondary highlights, illustration accents. | Black |
| **Green** | \#3D7700 | Confirmation, success state blocks. | White |

**Contrast & Accessibility:**

* **Black on Orange (\#000 on \#FF4F00):** Contrast ratio of \~6.37. AA compliant for body text.  
* **White on Orange (\#FFF on \#FF4F00):** Contrast ratio of \~3.30. **Use only for large text (≥24px or bold ≥18.7px).**  
* **White on Purple (\#FFF on \#4E18FF):** Contrast ratio of \~7.24. AA/AAA compliant.  
* **Black on Yellow (\#000 on \#FECC14):** Excellent contrast ratio of \~13.86.  
* **Black on Cream (\#000 on \#F9F2E7):** Excellent contrast ratio of \~18.88, ideal for long-form text.

### **4\. Logo Usage**

The Eletromidia logo is our most valuable asset. Its consistent and correct application is paramount.

**Core Assets:**

* **Monogram:** White monogram on an orange square.  
* **Wordmark:** eletromidia in black, for use on light backgrounds.

**Protection Rules:**

* **Scaling:** Always maintain proportions. Never stretch or distort the logo. **Hold SHIFT when resizing.**  
* **Clear Space:** Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the monogram's horizontal bar.  
* **Backgrounds:**  
  * **Preferred:** Brand Orange (\#FF4F00) for the monogram; White (\#FFFFFF) or Cream (\#F9F2E7) for the wordmark.  
  * **Avoid:** Busy photos without a solid color field behind the logo, or any low-contrast color pairings.

**Common Misuse (Do Not):**

* Apply drop shadows, bevels, glows, or other layer effects.  
* Rotate the logo.  
* Place the logo over gradients or backgrounds that reduce its contrast and legibility.

### **5\. Visual Language**

Our visual language combines geometric patterns, flat illustrations, and authentic photography to create a dynamic and human-centric identity.

**Shapes & Patterns:**

* **Arches:** Rounded-rect pillars (semi-capsules) rising from the baseline in rhythmic, repeating columns.  
* **Blob Ceiling:** Large, black, rounded shapes aligned to the top edge to frame content.  
* **Beams:** Yellow ray segments fanning out from a focal object.  
* **Rules:** Anchor shapes to grid edges. Use solid fills with no outlines.

**Illustration Style:**

* **Style:** Flat, geometric, and high-contrast with minimal outlines and solid fills. Proportions are often exaggerated, with expressive hands.  
* **Palette:** Use the brand palette. Skin tones are primarily yellow (\#FECC14) with black for facial lines. Clothing is dominated by black with accents.  
* **Technique:** Use large, simple shapes. Avoid realistic rendering, complex textures, or pastel colors.

**Photography Style:**

* **Style:** Candid, smiling, high-energy portraits and urban context shots.  
* **Lighting:** Soft, even lighting with high saturation. Avoid harsh shadows.  
* **Composition:** Tight crops on faces. Integrate geometric backdrops that echo brand shapes.  
* **Do:** Feature diverse casting and genuine expressions. Use plain, vivid backdrops with brand colors.  
* **Don't:** Use corporate stock clichés (e.g., handshakes, staged meetings). Avoid low-saturation or sepia filters.

### **6\. Layout & Composition**

A consistent grid and spacing scale create rhythm and order across all our communications.

**Grid Systems:**

* **Desktop Web:** 12 columns, 24px gutter, 80px side margins.  
* **Print (A4):** 12 columns, 12pt gutter, 15mm margins.

Spacing Scale (px):  
Our layout spacing is based on a 4px base unit. Use these values for margins, padding, and positioning elements.  
4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 56, 72, 96

### **7\. UI Components & Iconography**

**Iconography:**

* **Style:** Solid fills with rounded corners (4px radius). Use a 2px optical stroke when necessary for clarity.  
* **Grid:** Designed on a 24px grid.  
* **Color:** Default is black on light backgrounds, white on dark. Keep icons single-color for clarity.

**Buttons:**

* **Primary:**  
  * **Background:** Brand Orange (\#FF4F00)  
  * **Text:** Black (\#000000)  
  * **Radius:** 12px  
* **Secondary:**  
  * **Background:** Purple (\#4E18FF)  
  * **Text:** White (\#FFFFFF)

**Cards:**

* **Style:** Use a subtle box shadow for depth.  
* **Radius:** 20px  
* **Backgrounds:** White (\#FFFFFF) or Cream (\#F9F2E7)

### **8\. Accessibility**

We are committed to creating accessible experiences for everyone.

* **WCAG Target:** AA, aiming for AAA where feasible.  
* **Contrast:** Body text contrast must be ≥ 4.5:1.  
* **Color:** Do not convey meaning using color alone. Always include labels, icons, or other indicators.  
* **Images:** Provide descriptive alt text for all meaningful imagery and illustrations.  
* **Focus State:** Interactive elements must have a visible focus state: 2px solid \#4E18FF with a 2px offset.
